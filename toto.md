# TFG report

## Todo
- [x] Add a section in the state-of-the-art talking about CUDA and openGL (massive parallelism)
- [x] Add a section in the implementation talking about the python script for energy measurements from powermetrics
- [x] Add a section in the implementation talking about the Makefile and compilation
- [x] Finish Section 4 and 4.1 chapter introduction and general program design respectively 
- [x] Add a section on evaluation talking about the flags used to compiled the C++ code and make some graphs
- [x] Add a tree view of the files of all implementations
- [x] Add the text for the use cases, requirements and traceability matrix
- [ ] Check why the font has changed in the report, it is not the same as the template (some package that has been added?)

### Evaluating results Server
- [x] Talk about the server results pkg, the ones in bold from c++ are interesting
- [x] Talk about the server results ram, not much change? Same data
- [x] Talk about the server results time execution, give some numbers 
- [x] Talk about the mbp results energy
- [x] Talk about the mbp results time
- [x] Put in bold the important results from the table 5.7, goroutines and threads.
- [x] Talk about these results.
- [x] Add graphs for the flag optimization results.

### Testing
- [x] Get the tester for the raspberry and test the code. IMPORTANT, less samples are used as the performance of the device is much lower than the server or laptop, and to reduce extreme execution times

- [x] Create graphs for the results of the raspberry, and add them to the report
- [ ] Talk about the results of the raspberry, and add them to the report

- [ ] Test for personal PC (R7 3800X)
- [ ] Create graphs for the results of the personal PC, and add them to the report
- [ ] Talk about the PCs results pkg, 
- [ ] Talk about the PCs results ram, 
- [ ] Talk about the PCs results execution time
