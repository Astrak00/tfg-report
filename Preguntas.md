2.2.5 GPU and Accelerators
Table 2.1
Generic programming -> Generics?
"Based on the programming language C, released in 1978 as a high-level language at the time, compared to assembly."

2.3.4 Other languages:
As a contender for a fast, high energy efficient language we could have used Rust, a recently new programming language, focused on performance and type-safety. As Rust is a compiled language and uses the same \gls{LLVM} backend for compilation, a similar result is to be expected from this benchmark compared to the C++ implementation, thus, I excluded it from the study.

## 3. Problem Statement
"All of these requirements have been defined following the standard"

## 4. Design and Implementation 
OpenMP

Pasar bien por referencia -> no "re-asignar", usar in-place 

## 5. Evaluation
Quitado el párrafo de introducción, excepto -r 5

Ver como cambiar el speedup ???
